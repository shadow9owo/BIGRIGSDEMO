this source code is for the linux port (this game was developed on linux though)

# Issues
- Widow scaling is dependent on the main monitor meaning that the window scales incorrectly if ran on a different monitor than monitor 0
- running the game without ./assets/ on windows causes a **BLUESCREEN OF DEATH**

built on windows 10,ubuntu 22.045 (kernel 6.11)
